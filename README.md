# "Choose Me" Game Concept

## 1. Overall Game Vision

This is a life simulator with RPG and gacha mechanics elements, inspired by the "Choose Me" web comic. Players will manage a world populated by unique, procedurally generated characters. The key feature is deep interaction of characters with the world and each other, powered by AI, as well as visual styling generated by neural networks.

**Genre:** Life Simulator, RPG, Sandbox.

**Key Features:**

- **Unique Characters:** Each character is randomly generated based on a set of tags (JSON) using AI, creating infinite variety of heroes.
- **Dynamic World:** Characters live their own lives, interact with the environment and other NPCs without direct player control.
- **Visual Flexibility:** Ability to switch between different visual styles (anime, realism, cinematic, cartoon) thanks to AI image generation.
- **Freedom of Choice:** Players can choose an era for their world: from fantasy and medieval to cyberpunk and steampunk.

## 2. Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

### Backend - [Go1.25](./Go1.25)

**Technologies:** Go 1.25.1, Gin, PostgreSQL, Redis, JWT

Server application handling all game logic, authentication, and database interactions.

**Main Functions:**
- RESTful API for client
- Authentication system (JWT)
- User and clan management
- Game logic and procedural generation
- Integration with n8n for image generation

**Architecture:** Clean Architecture (handler → service → repository)

### Frontend - [Nuxt4](./Nuxt4)

**Technologies:** Nuxt 4, Nuxt UI, Pinia, TypeScript

Client web application (SPA) providing the game's user interface.

**Main Functions:**
- Registration and authorization
- Personal account and settings
- Game interface
- Gacha mechanics
- Payment system

### Automation - [n8n](./n8n)

**Technologies:** n8n, llm, AI Image Generation

Automation service for generating character and location images using neural networks.

**Main Functions:**
- Character image generation
- Location generation
- Processing requests from Backend
- Generation queue management
